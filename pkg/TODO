space$settings : persistantly store the settings with each space

performances(performances(ppl), purpose="ab")
or better: purpose(performances(p), "ab")

near(path())
predict(path())

remove Domain$corpus method?! better: restrict to Term Document Matrices!

plot by incidences / evidence
plot(documents): how to link with CompetencePortfolio
plot(both)

allow for adding persons and performances WITHOUT space (recalc plot from traces)!

# learning conversations (bipartite, social)
learning conversation:
personA, personB, personA writes something, personB reads it, ...,
-> plot competence positions for each dialogue move, connect positions for each move?
-> end states after conversation

interactions between persons e.g. from message discourse?
important notice: the social interaction idea is actually in the distributional hypothesis!

idea: implement Arith group generics to allow newDomain = dmgr$get("generic") + dmgr$get("reflection")
the + .Primitive should then be overriden to combine the corpora or textmatrices of the two domains and calculate a new space
i.e. executing the textmatrix functions for each corpus and then merging the matrices, then execute their LSA

count lines of code:
find . -name "*.[rR]" -print0 | xargs -0 wc -l

try the BAWE corpus (knowledge cartography/ota).
