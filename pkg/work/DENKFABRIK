BUILDING

always dmgr$upgrade() the two spaces when preparing a new release!
Make sure that the domain and visualiser have a new version number

count lines of code:
find . -name "*.[rR]" -print0 | xargs -0 wc -l

UNFINISHED IDEAS

* add:
predict(path())

* remove Domain$corpus method?! better: restrict to Term Document Matrices!

* plot by incidences / evidence
* plot(documents): how to link with CompetencePortfolio
* plot(both)

* allow for adding persons and performances WITHOUT
space (recalc plot from traces)!

* learning conversations (bipartite, social)
personA, personB, personA writes something, personB reads it, ...,
-> plot competence positions for each dialogue move, connect positions for each move?
-> end states after conversation

* interactions between persons e.g. from message discourse?
note: the social interaction idea is actually in the distributional hypothesis!

* implement Arith group generics to allow
newDomain = dmgr$get("generic") + dmgr$get("reflection")
the + .Primitive should then be overriden to combine the corpora or textmatrices
of the two domains and calculate a new space i.e. executing the textmatrix functions
for each corpus and then merging the matrices, then execute their LSA
